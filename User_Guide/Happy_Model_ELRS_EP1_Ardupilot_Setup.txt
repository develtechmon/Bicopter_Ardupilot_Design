I'm using UART 2 of MATEK or TX2 and RTX. To enable Happy Model ELRS EP1, i enable following parameter in ardupilot.

SERIAL6_PROTOCOL = 23
SERIAL6_BAUD = 115
SERIAL6_OPTIONS = 0
RC_PROTOCOL = 1
RSSI_TYPE = 3
BRD_ALT_CONFIG = 1 Then reboot your drone for change to take place.
FLTMODE_CH = 8
RC_OPTIONS = 1824 (default is 32) or 3872
Here we need to enable 
1. Use passthrough for CRSF telemetry
2. Suppress CRSF mode/rate message for ELRS systems
3. Enable multiple receiver support

Also i set CHANNEL9 as my arm. This can be configure in extended config.
From controller (T-Lite Jumper), i went to input and channel section of 9 and name
it as arm.

From Ardupilot, i set the Channel 9 as my arm
